# project-script-generation

This project is based on the [TV script-generation](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-tv-script-generation) to train your adversarial networks.

It generates its own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs and a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network will generate a new, "fake" TV script.
